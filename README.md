Hello, my name is Temi Ijisesan and welcome to my personal portfolio site! I created this application using REACT, HTML, and CSS using Javascript animation libraries such as GSAP to make my animations come to life. As a designer, I wanted to focus on developing my frontend programming skills by creating a super interactive project. Most of the site uses SVGs to create complex animations. Feel free to explore my code to further understand how I used these frontend languages and frameworks!
